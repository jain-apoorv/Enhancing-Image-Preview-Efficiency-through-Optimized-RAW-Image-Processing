# Enhancing-Image-Preview-Efficiency-through-Optimized-RAW-Image-Processing
This project aims to optimize the steps from loading a RAW image to displaying it, specifically considering mobile computing needs. Given the constraints of memory and processing power in mobile devices

the following optimizations were implemented for an efficient, lightweight preview:
## 1. Loading and Demosaicing
The initial phase of processing involves loading the RAW image data and converting it into an RGB image format. Typically, high-quality demosaicing uses the Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed (AHD) algorithm, which is effective but computationally intensive. To improve efficiency, we opted for the Linear Demosaic algorithm. This simpler, faster algorithm provides a basic interpolation, allowing for reduced load time and memory usage. While AHD offers superior quality, Linear Demosaic balances quality with the speed required for a quick preview in resource-limited environments.

## 2. Downsampling
Once the RAW image is converted to RGB, the image dimensions are reduced by downscaling the resolution by 50%. This significant reduction in image size helps to lower memory consumption while accelerating the processing time. The downsized resolution provides a more efficient preview suitable for quick viewing, reducing the computational load without severely impacting the perceived quality of the image.
## 3. Bit Depth Reduction
To further reduce resource usage, the image is converted from 16-bit to 8-bit per channel. This adjustment effectively cuts memory usage by half while maintaining adequate color detail and quality for a preview. Bit depth reduction is particularly advantageous in mobile settings, where memory availability may be limited, making it an ideal step for balancing performance with visual quality.
## 4. Light Sharpening
To enhance visual clarity, a light sharpening filter is applied using the Unsharp Mask technique. This step compensates for any slight softness that may have been introduced by the previous downsampling, focusing on edge clarity and detail without creating artifacts. The Unsharp Mask selectively enhances the contrast around edges, resulting in a clearer, more refined preview that perceptually approximates the original imageâ€™s quality.

## Results

Below is a comparison of the key performance metrics for the optimized preview and the full-quality image (without optimizations):


| **Metric**               | **Full Quality Image (Default)** | **Optimized Preview** | **Improvement**       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Load Time**            | ~4.5 seconds                     | ~2.5 seconds          | 44% faster             |
| **Memory Usage**         | ~122 MB                          | ~31 MB                | 75% reduction          |
| **Image Quality (PSNR)** | Baseline                         | ~40.88 dB             | Comparable quality     |
